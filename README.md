# Machine-Learning-project
Definition: Surface Defect Classification for Metals
The project is about detecting and classifying defects on a highly reflected surface.
The defect must be classified into six different categories. Crazing, inclusion, patches, pitted surface, rolled-in-scale, and scratches are the classes.

Dataset Details:
The data set is divided into two folders: one for training and one for validation.
The training and validation folders are made up of six defect folders. Each folder in the training set contains 240 grey scale images, while each folder in the validation set contains 60 grey scale images.
 As a result, the total number of images in the training set is 1440 and 360 in the validation set. The total number of grayscale images is 1800.

Features Taken:
The features used are the image's part and patterns where the defect was discovered. The images are read using the imread function and converted to an array for feature extraction.

Algorithm Used:
Random Forest..
Naive bayes
SVM
